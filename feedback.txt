Hello Evgeny and Ilya,

Here's your Django project review:

- You've made solid use of Django and Django REST Framework features. The way you're using signals to update the 'tag' count upon `post_save` and `post_delete` events demonstrates good practical understanding. Additionally, the use of `SerializerMethodField` and `SlugRelatedField` shows you've understood the different types of fields serializers can handle. Good job on that!

- In terms of your views and URL design, you have a well-structured system. However, try to avoid using the '*' wildcard to import all views, models, or serializers. It's better practice to be explicit about what you're importing. Your usage of the `APIView` class is commendable - you've shown a good understanding of the `get` and `post` methods.

- For error handling and validation, there's room for improvement. Ensure you consider edge cases for your models, serializers, and views. Don't forget to use validations and try-except blocks to handle possible exceptions and errors.

- On documentation, it appears you haven't provided comments or explanations for your classes and functions. Remember, good documentation is critical for any development project, as it makes it easier for others (and yourselves) to understand the code, debug issues, and contribute to the project.

- A general comment regarding project organization: you've included your `.env` file in the repository. This is a major security concern as this file typically contains sensitive data such as secret keys and database passwords. Consider using third-party packages to handle `.env` files securely.

- Lastly, it's great to see you're integrating JavaScript for front-end development! This is a significant step towards becoming full-stack developers, and opens up many opportunities for enhancing your project.

Keep improving and refining your skills. Django has a lot to offer, and every project is an opportunity to explore new facets of this robust framework. Best of luck!

Best,
Yossi
